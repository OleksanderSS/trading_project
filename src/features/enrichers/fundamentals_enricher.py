"""Value ratios, each built only from numbers already filed at the bar.

The first features in this system that are not derived from price. Measured on
2026-08-23, all 430 existing ones are: the strongest reaches an out-of-sample
IC of 0.046, no model built from all of them beats it, and 171 of 448 cannot
even vary between names on a date. New information has to come from outside the
price series, and a company's own accounts are the oldest source there is.

Three things decide whether this is honest.

**Availability is `filed`.** A June quarter reaches the SEC in August. Joining
on the period it describes would put it into June's bars -- measured on Apple's
filings, the shortest gap between a period ending and the filing that first
reported it is 25 days, and the median across all repeats is 216. Every join
here is `merge_asof(..., direction="backward")` on the filing date.

**The latest view AS OF the bar, not the latest view.** The same quarter is
restated by later filings, and 1,972 of Apple's 2,939 facts are such repeats.
Taking today's number for a bar in 2019 would be reading a correction written
years afterwards. The backward join takes what was on the record then.

**A flow concept is picked by its SPAN.** `NetIncomeLoss` arrives for the
quarter AND for the year to date, both ending the same day, from the same
filing. Mixing them silently multiplies earnings by up to four. Only entries
whose span looks quarterly are used, and the rule is explicit rather than
implied by whichever row happened to sort first.

Ratios needing a price use the bar's own close, which is known at the bar by
definition. Ratios that do not are computed from the accounts alone, so they
survive on a frame with no price at all.
